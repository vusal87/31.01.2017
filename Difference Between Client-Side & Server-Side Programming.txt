Programming

Server-side Programming

Server-side programming, is the general name for the kinds of programs which are run on the Server.

Uses

Process user input.
Display pages.
Structure web applications.
Interact with permanent storage (SQL, files).
Example Languages

PHP
Python
ASP.Net in C#, C++, or Visual Basic.
Nearly any language (C++, C#, Java). These were not designed specifically for the task, but are now often used for application-level web services.


Client-side programming

Much like the server-side, Client-side programming is the name for all of the programs which are run on the Client.

Uses

Make interactive webpages.
Make stuff happen dynamically on the web page.
Interact with temporary storage, and local storage (Cookies, localStorage).
Send requests to the server, and retrieve data from it.
Provide a remote service for client-side applications, such as software registration, content delivery, or remote multi-player gaming.
Example languages

JavaScript (primarily)
HTML*
CSS*
Any language running on a client device that interacts with a remote service is a client-side language.

QEYD*HTML and CSS aren't really "programming languages" per-se. They are markup syntax by which the Client renders the page for the User.
